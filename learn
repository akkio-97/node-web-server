var app=express() is a function
app.get()
app.listen()

views is default directory for templates that express uses.

app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
//public stores all static files

hbs.registerPartials(file_path) //where view is default libr.
hbs.registerHelper(call_back)

handlebar is a view engine
partials are nothing but templates like header and footer that you are willing to keep common
